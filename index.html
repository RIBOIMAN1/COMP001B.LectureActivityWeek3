            <p>Halloween, celebrated annually on October 31st, is a festival that has its roots in ancient Celtic traditions. The Celts celebrated Samhain, a festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. They believed that on this night, the boundary between the living and the dead was blurred, allowing spirits to roam the earth. People would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off these wandering spirits, a tradition that has evolved into the modern-day practice of donning spooky costumes and masks.</p>
